# Module 1 Project: Showffuer Live Music Application 

For this project, we built out an application called Showffuer. Showffuer allows its "users" to find live music "shows" in the tri-state area (New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey) and add "shows" that interest them to a list of "events". 

## Skills Highlighted 

1. Accessed a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.
2. Built three models, which include User, Show, ane Event. 
3. Built out a CLI that gave your user full CRUD ability.
    * Create a new user.
    * Create a new event. 
    * Read a list of all of the events. 
    * Read a list of all of the shows. 
    * Update their list of events. 
    * Delete events from their list of events.  
4. Used good OO design patterns by using separate models for your runner and CLI interface.
